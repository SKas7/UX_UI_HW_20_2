            <h3>About the Project</h3><br>
            <p>Feline Rescue is a animal humane society for cats. Their goal is to shelter homeless cats and provide
                care for the cats in need.
                Our primary goal in working with them was to improve their website design and navigation to improve
                their online presence. </p>
            <h3>My Role</h3><br>
            <p>For this project, I worked in a group of three people whose names are Kina Vang and Holly Clark.
                My primary role in the group was to conduct UX research, ideate structure of updated website, and
                prototyping.</p>
            <h3>Deliverables</h3><br>
            <p>Our deliverable for this project was a prototype of a redesigned website for Feline Rescue.</p>
            <h3>Tools Used</h3><br>
            <p>Figjam, Figma, Google Drive, Miro</p>
            <h3>Timeline/Scope</h3><br>
            <p>This project was conducted on a 2-week sprint. After analyzing the Feline Rescue website, we focused on
                the adoption process of the cats.</p>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3><br>
            <p>Feline Rescue was designed to achieve cat adoption/contributions. We have observed that our service is
                not user friendly,
                which is detering people’s business. How might we improve the Feline Rescue website so that our
                customers are more successful based on online inquiries?</p>

            <p>In the future, I would like to spend more time prototyping icons and aesthetics to the website 
                to be more immersive/fun for the user. I would also like to expand the cat description page to 
                include more visuals that include more content. </p>
            <h4>Lesson's Learned</h4>
            <p>Working with stakeholders was a very interesting aspect of this project. I learned how important 
                it is to communicate with the stakeholders when re-designing a website. It was interesting to learn 
                what they wanted communicated in their website so that we could help them administer them in our re-design 
                of their website. <br>

                It was also interesting to work on this project as a group. It was challenging to keep everyone on the same 
                page as well as come up with a decision together. I also found that with such a short time frame it can be 
                stressful to complete all our tasks as a group. I found that communication was key to our group project as 
                it keeps everyone on track and on the same page.
